# CDK Drag Drop with Ionic Capacitor

This is an attempt to use CDK drag and drop with an ionic capacitor mobile app.

Some issues were noticed.

1. Auto scroll fails on devices, but works on a desktop browser.
2. After autoscrolling, the drop target is off the screen and cannot be dropped in the desired spot.
3. The default drop placeholder size is sometimes too small.
